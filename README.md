## Recycle-App
An app to identify which bin an object belongs to.
## Motivation
We created this app as a part of the Cisco Hack-a-Thon, but our primary motivation arose from the blatant lack of knowledge about what can be recycled, and what cannot be. When materials that cannot be recycled are placed in the recycling bin, they sometimes cannot be sorted out, and the entire batch is sent to general waste. This app is meant to serve as a solution to increase the amount recycling we do.
## Screenshots 
## Tech and Framework Used
We used [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to develop our application.
## Installation
In order to install our application, it needs to be uploaded to the App Store or the Google Play Store, or it can be run on an iOS or Android simulator.
## How-to-Use
To use this app, open it, and from the home page, navigate to the camera page. There, you can take an image of whatever item you are trying to recycle.
## Credits
We relied heavily on the course Flutter Crash Course for Beginners 2020 by Academind to learn how to do flutter.
