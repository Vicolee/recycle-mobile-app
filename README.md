# recycle-app
An app to identify which bin an object belongs to.
# motivation
We created this app as a part of the Cisco Hack-a-Thon, but our primary motivation arose from the blatant lack of knowledge about what can be recycled, and what cannot be. When materials that cannot be recycled are placed in the recycling bin, they sometimes cannot be sorted out, and the entire batch is sent to general waste. This app is meant to serve as a solution to increase the amount recycling we do.
